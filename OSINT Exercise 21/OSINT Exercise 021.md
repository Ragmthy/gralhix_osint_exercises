## Task Goal

Maps can appear in the most unique places. In this case, it's in a chocolate bar. Next to it, is a satellite view of the same location. </br>

The goal is to find the coordinates of the location seen in both images. </br>

### Write-up and Thought Process

**Part 1: Initial Thoughts & Observations** </br>
Chocolate tablet looks fantastic. Chances are this is probably from a niche chocolatier as it features a map on it, which is very rare. There's no obvious signature or name of the chocolatier except for the top right corner: a "Do it Right" symbol. It might be in reference to best practices for chocolate manufacturing, and it could be in the small scale. </br>

 It can act as a first clue for looking up the chocolatier. </br>


**Part 2: Looking up the chocolatier** </br>
When googling "Chocolate with map 'do it right'", one promising result is by [Cocoa Runners](https://cocoarunners.com/blog/do-it-right-with-puchero/). They have a write up of a maker called Puchero. Pivoting off that, we can find its [official website](https://somospuchero.com/en/category-product/chocolate-en/). </br>

When looking up the [bars](https://somospuchero.com/en/category-product/chocolate-en/) Puchero sells, and hovering over each image, they showcase the chocolate as having a similar map to the ones in the task photo. </br>

Therefore, we can confirm that Puchero is the chocolatier we're interested in for this task. 

**Part 3: Geolocating the map on the bars**</br>
While each bar showcases ingredients from various places around the world, one thing that is good to note is that the map imprinted on **all** the bars is the same. That means, it is a location of utmost importance: it might be the founder's home, or even the locality map of the Puchero factory. As not a lot is mentioned about the founder's hometown (apart from the country they were in previously before starting Puchero), let's first start with the factory's address.

When navigating to the [Get in Touch](https://somospuchero.com/en/contact/) page of Puchero, there is a Google Map of their location in Valladoid, Spain. This is confirmed as well in the write-up by [Cocoa Runners](https://cocoarunners.com/blog/do-it-right-with-puchero/#:~:text=specialty%20coffee%20roastery%20and%20now%20a%20craft%20chocolate%20factory%20in%20Valladolid%2C%20Spain.). When comparing that address's satellite view, against the task image, there are some similarities but more needs to be done. </br>

Similar to the task's satellite photo, the google map images has these similarities in common, like this triangular land, and the half-cloud one: </br>

Therefore, it needs to be rotated 180Â°, to match the orientation of the chocolate bar's map. </br>

Coincidentally, even the Puchero Factory location falls within the screenshot of the map. Using that marker, and finding its coordinates to roughly be
41.35209215391813, -4.689901804676438. </br>
